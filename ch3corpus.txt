"Shape Of My Heart"

He deals the cards as a meditation,
And those he plays never suspect.
He doesn't play for the money he wins.
He doesn't play for respect.

He deals the cards to find the answer,
The sacred geometry of chance,
The hidden laws of a probable outcome.
The numbers lead a dance.

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier.
I know that the clubs are weapons of war.
I know that diamonds mean money for this art,
But that's not the shape of my heart.

He may play the Jack of diamonds.
He may lay the Queen of spades.
He may conceal a King in his hand
While the memory of it fades.
